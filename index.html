For most microservices based applications, it makes sense to implement an API Gateway, which acts as a single entry point into a system. The API Gateway is responsible for request routing, composition, and protocol translation. It provides each of the application's clients with a custom API

API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management.</p>

<p class="title feature-title">Eventual Consistency vs Strong Consistency</p>
<p class="feature-subtitle">
Eventual consistency is a theoretical guarantee that, provided no new updates to an entity are made, all reads of the entity will eventually return the last updated value. 

In contrast, traditional relational databases have been designed based on the concept of strong consistency, also called immediate consistency. This means that data viewed immediately after an update will be consistent for all observers of the entity. This characteristic has been a fundamental assumption for many developers who use relational databases. 

Strong Consistency offers up-to-date data but at the cost of high latency.

Eventual consistency offers low latency at the risk of returning stale data

<p class="feature-subtitle">
Polling is the process of querying the queues to check if there are any new messages in the queue for processing.

Amazon SQS long polling is a way to retrieve messages from your Amazon SQS queues. While the regular short polling returns immediately, even if the message queue being polled is empty, long polling doesnâ€™t return a response until a message arrives in the message queue, or the long poll times out.

Short Polling returns immediately if the queue is empty.

There are various use cases for each method and we need to pick the polling method based on specific use case.</p>
